## Document Introduction

### Creation Purposes

This document or readme file / repository was created with the sole intent to allow quick navigation through my misc JS portfolio project folder. Smaller projects I create that I don't want to dedicate a space to go here, with a quick description of each project

### Information About The Projects

The projects / items here are all smaller side projects I have taken on that while not nessecarily are meant to be standalone projects or apps they are ones I want to include on my portfolio in the form ofa misc / extras section. These could be small scale apps like a countdown timer to tools I built to help me with every day coding

### Copywrite / Licensing

Much like my main portfolio all code showcased in this portfolio (unless specified under the actual section below) will be subject to use under the GPLv3 free use license.

### Projects
