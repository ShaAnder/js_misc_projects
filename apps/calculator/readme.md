## Introduction

The scientific calculator app is a small app I wanted to create using HTML CSS and JS to showcase the skills I have learnt, while maths was not a subject i was empassioned by when in school it is something I have grown to deeply enjoy and have always wanted to build some things related to it, this is the first step

### What Is It

At it's core it's a scientific calculator, it's designed to act in the same way as a physical one and as such should have all the working functions of a scientific calculator including the computation that one can do.

### Why This?

As I said in the introduction I have become empassioned with maths in my later years and want to build apps and programs around it, this is the first step in a series of projects I will create to help people enjoy the subject more

## Project Brief

### In Depth Description

The calculator at it's core is a series of button elements that can be clicked to execute mathmatic equations and operations such as recording the button click (numbers) to the screen, functions like addition, subtraction and even more complex conversions like sin cos and tan, ect.

### Working Breakdown

The program works in 2 ways,

First we have the HTML and CSS to build the basic calculator structure, this will serve to create the basic look / design as well as also all the buttons for us to click

Secondly we have the JS running in the background which is there to click the button elements and execute the functions that each button represents, for arguments sake if we record numbers and click the sin cos or tan it will convert the number and calculator to that mode

AS for our functions, and how they work, I have chosen to omit certain things that most scientific calculators do, such as throwing an error if you don't put the correct format in eg sin(x) instead when you press the number then the sin function it automatically calculates it

SO far this calculator can do

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Floor Division %
- Parenthesies
- Sin Cos Tan
- Squared / Exponent (^2) (\*\*)
- Pi
- Log
- Radic
- exp

## Learning Points & Takeaway

This project is going to test what I know so far and encourage me to learn more for all 3 languages (html, css, js) the end result is that id like to build a fully working application that can be used on mobile or desktop to act as a tool for math solving.

## Version History

- v.01 - Created basic code structure for the calculator look and design
- v.02 - Added basic functions and core calculation functionality, double checked with other calculators to see if it worked
- v.03 - Did a sweep of refactoring to clean up the code base and optimize it, swapped from an if else chain to an object and function calling

## TODO

There are still parts to complete with this project such as the inv and in buttons as well as expanded functionality and maybe a keyboard, im basing this project off of other calculator applications found on the internet

As well as this the next step is to clean up the JS code as i used a lot of if else to get it up and running, the current goal is to explore storing all the functions as properties in an object that I can then call whenever I press a button.
